## How It Works

### Database Structure
The assignment works through the `class_schedules` table, which links:
- **Subject** (via `subject_code`)
- **Lecturer** (via `lecturer_id`)
- **Program** (via `program_code`)

### Lecturer Creation Process
1. Check if lecturer already exists (by email)
2. If not, create User account with lecturer role
3. Create Lecturer profile with specialization matching the subject
4. Create ClassSchedule linking lecturer to subject

### Data Used
- **Source**: `program_subjects` table (contains program-subject relationships)
- **Relationships**: 
  - Program → ProgramSubject (many-to-many via `program_id`)
  - Lecturer → ClassSchedule (one-to-many)
  - ClassSchedule → Subject (many-to-one via `subject_code`)

## Seeder File
**Location**: `database/seeders/AssignLecturersToAllProgramSubjectsSeeder.php`

## Login Information
All lecturers can log in using:
- **Email**: Based on subject name (automatically generated)
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Note**: All lecturers are required to change their password on first login

## Verification
To verify the assignments, you can run:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Then query:
```php
// Get all lecturers
Lecturer::count();

// Get all class schedules
ClassSchedule::count();

// Get class schedules by program
ClassSchedule::where('program_code', 'EMBA')->count();
ClassSchedule::where('program_code', 'EBBA')->count();
ClassSchedule::where('program_code', 'EDBA')->count();
```

## Next Steps
1. All lecturers need to complete their profile information
2. Lecturers should update their bio with more specific information
3. Adjust class schedules (venue, times, dates) as needed
4. Assign additional lecturers for subjects that need multiple sections

## Notes
- The seeder automatically handles duplicate prevention
- If you run it again, it will skip existing assignments
- Lecturers with the same name but different subjects will have unique emails
- Each program maintains its own lecturer numbering system
