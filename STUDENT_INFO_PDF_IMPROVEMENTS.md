    if ($request->filled('search')) {
        // Searches name, student_id, email, ic_passport, ic
    }
    
    // Filter by program
    if ($request->filled('program')) {
        $query->where('programme_code', $request->program);
    }
    
    // Show all or paginate
    $perPage = $request->input('show_all', 'no') === 'yes' ? 100000 : 20;
    
    // Get unique programs for filter dropdown
    $programs = User::where('role', 'student')
                   ->whereNotNull('programme_code')
                   ->distinct()
                   ->get();
