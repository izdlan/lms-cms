- **EMBA**: 12 lecturers (one per subject)
- **EBBA**: 12 lecturers (one per subject)
- **EDBA**: 12 lecturers (one per subject)

### 2. Class Schedules Created (36 total)

## üéØ How Class Interface Works

When a student clicks on a **class code** (e.g., `BAS111_CLASS_001`):

**URL:** `/student/course/{subjectCode}/class`

**Example:** `/student/course/BAS111/class`

**Shows:**
1. ‚úÖ Course Summary (description, learning outcomes)
2. ‚úÖ Announcements (from lecturers)
3. ‚úÖ Course Content (materials, videos, documents)
4. ‚úÖ Assignments (with submission status)
5. ‚úÖ Discussions
