# Lecturer Fix Summary

## Problem
- Created **36 lecturers** (12 unique names × 3 duplicates for EMBA, EBBA, EDBA)
- Each lecturer was duplicated 3 times (once for each program)
- Redundant entries created unnecessary complexity

## Solution
- Consolidated **36 lecturers down to 12 unique lecturers**
- Moved all class schedules and student enrollments to the primary lecturer
- Deleted 24 duplicate lecturer records
- Kept the first instance of each lecturer (by ID)

## Current State

### Lecturers (12 total)
1. Dr. John Smith (3 classes)
2. Dr. Sarah Johnson (3 classes)
3. Dr. Michael Williams (3 classes)
4. Dr. Emily Jones (3 classes)
5. Dr. David Brown (3 classes)
6. Dr. Lisa Davis (3 classes)
7. Dr. James Miller (3 classes)
8. Dr. Maria Wilson (3 classes)
9. Dr. Alex Moore (3 classes)
10. Dr. Jennifer Taylor (3 classes)
11. Dr. Robert Anderson (3 classes)
12. Dr. Amanda Thomas (3 classes)

### Class Distribution
- **Total Class Schedules**: 36
- **Average per lecturer**: 3 classes each
- Each lecturer teaches 1 EMBA subject, 1 EBBA subject, and 1 EDBA subject

## Changes Made

### Before
```
36 lecturers
- 12 lecturers × 3 duplicates = 36 total
- Each duplicate assigned to only 1 program
```

### After  
```
12 lecturers
- Each lecturer teaches subjects across all 3 programs
- More efficient organization
- No duplicate staff records
```

## Class Schedule Assignments

Each lecturer now teaches:
- **1 EMBA subject** (e.g., EMBA7101, EMBA7102, etc.)
- **1 EBBA subject** (e.g., PMOB101, HRM102, etc.)
- **1 EDBA subject** (e.g., MKT8101E, ACC8101E, etc.)

Total: **36 class schedules** distributed among **12 lecturers** (3 each)

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No more duplicates** - Each lecturer has a unique profile
2. ✅ **Better organization** - One lecturer record per person
3. ✅ **Easier management** - Single profile to update
4. ✅ **Cleaner database** - 24 fewer redundant records
5. ✅ **Maintained relationships** - All class schedules and enrollments preserved

## Verification

```bash
# Check lecturer count
php artisan tinker
Lecturer::count(); // Should return 12

# Check class schedules
ClassSchedule::count(); // Should return 36

# Each lecturer has 3 classes
ClassSchedule::groupBy('lecturer_id')
    ->selectRaw('lecturer_id, count(*) as count')
    ->get();
```

All relationships are maintained and working correctly!
